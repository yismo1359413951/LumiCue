# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, report them privately using one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory** — open a draft advisory at [github.com/duongductrong/Snapzy/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/duongductrong/Snapzy/security/advisories/new)
2. **Email** — contact the maintainer at the email address listed on the [GitHub profile](https://github.com/duongductrong)

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Affected version(s) and macOS version
- Potential impact

You should receive an initial acknowledgment within **72 hours**. A fix or mitigation will be communicated before public disclosure.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| Latest release | ✅ |
| Older releases | ❌ — please upgrade |

Only the latest release receives security updates. If a critical vulnerability is confirmed, a patch release will be published as soon as possible.

## App Sandbox & Permissions

Snapzy runs inside the **macOS App Sandbox**. The entitlements it requests and why:

| Entitlement | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` | Sandboxed execution — limits access to system resources |
| `com.apple.security.network.client` | Outbound network for Sparkle update checks and user-initiated cloud uploads |
| `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write` | Read/write files the user explicitly picks (save dialogs, drag-to-app) |
| `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` | Microphone access for screen recordings with voice |
| `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.shared-preference.read-only` | Read `com.apple.symbolichotkeys` to detect system shortcut conflicts |
| `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.mach-lookup.global-name` | IPC with Sparkle updater (`-spks`, `-spki` services) |

### Permissions requested at runtime

| Permission | Required | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Screen Recording | Yes | Core functionality — capturing the screen via ScreenCaptureKit |
| Microphone | Optional | Recording system audio + voice in screen recordings |
| Accessibility | Optional | Keystroke overlays and mouse click highlights during recording |

All permissions are requested through standard macOS prompts and can be revoked at any time in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.

## Data Handling

- **Local-first** — All captures and recordings are stored locally. Cloud upload is opt-in and sends files only to **your own** AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2 bucket — no third-party servers are involved.
- **No telemetry** — No analytics, tracking, or usage data is collected.
- **No accounts** — No sign-in, registration, or user accounts.
- **Network usage** — Outbound requests are limited to Sparkle update checks (appcast over HTTPS) and user-initiated cloud uploads. Both can be disabled in Preferences.
- **Passive QR decoding** — QR codes detected during OCR capture are decoded locally and copied only as plain text. Snapzy does not auto-open QR URLs, expand links over the network, execute commands, load WebViews, or place QR payloads on the pasteboard as file URLs.

## Cloud Credentials

- **Keychain storage** — Cloud access keys and secret keys are stored exclusively in the macOS Keychain, never in plaintext files or UserDefaults.
- **Optional password protection** — Users can set a protection password for cloud credentials. The password is SHA-256 hashed before storage; no plaintext password is persisted.
- **Manual encrypted transfer** — Users may export cloud credentials only through an explicit in-app action. Exported archives are encrypted with a user-supplied passphrase and are never uploaded or synced by Snapzy.
- **No relay servers** — Uploads go directly from the app to the user's own S3/R2 endpoint using AWS Signature V4 authentication. Snapzy never proxies or stores files on its own infrastructure.

## Auto-Updates (Sparkle)

Snapzy uses [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) for in-app updates:

- Update checks are made over HTTPS against a signed appcast
- Downloaded updates are verified with EdDSA signatures before installation
- Users can disable automatic update checks in Preferences

## Third-Party Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) | In-app updates | Swift Package Manager |

Snapzy has minimal third-party dependencies. The codebase relies primarily on Apple frameworks (SwiftUI, AppKit, ScreenCaptureKit, Vision, AVFoundation).

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

- Do not hard-code secrets, keys, or tokens in the source code.
- Do not introduce new entitlements without documenting the reason.
- Do not disable or weaken the App Sandbox.
- Follow Apple's [Secure Coding Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide/) for any new platform integrations.
