## Agent Reading Order

- Capture, scrolling capture, recording: `STRUCTURE.md` -> `CAPTURE.md`
- Tests: `STRUCTURE.md` -> `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Localization or user-facing copy: `STRUCTURE.md` -> `LOCALIZATION.md` -> `CAPTURE.md` when capture/editor UX is affected
- Onboarding, menu bar, preferences: `STRUCTURE.md`
- TOML config export/import: `STRUCTURE.md` -> `CONFIGURATION.md`
- Cloud storage and upload UX: `STRUCTURE.md` + `CAPTURE.md`
- Build, release, updater: `DEVELOPMENT.md` -> `BUILD.md` -> `RELEASES.md` -> `UPDATE_TESTING.md`

## Current Behavior Notes

- `AfterCaptureAction.save` decides whether captures go straight to the export folder or into `~/Library/Application Support/Snapzy/Captures/` as temp files.
- `AfterCaptureAction.uploadToCloud` currently enables Quick Access cloud-upload entry points for screenshots, videos, and GIFs, plus Annotate cloud upload for screenshots. It is not executed directly by `PostCaptureActionHandler`.
- GIF recording flow first creates a video, inserts it into Quick Access, converts it, then swaps the card to the GIF output.
- Quick Access cards can be dismissed with the visible dismiss action, the existing mouse swipe, or an optional two-finger horizontal swipe on the preview card.
- Annotate and Video Editor temporarily elevate Snapzy from accessory mode to regular app mode so the editor windows appear in Dock and Cmd+Tab.
- Screenshot annotations that have been committed are persisted as sidecar packages in `Application Support/Snapzy/AnnotationSessions/`, so History restore can reopen editable annotations instead of only the flattened image.
- Annotation sidecars are cleaned with their source screenshots through Quick Access delete, History delete, clear-history, retention sweep, and temp-to-export save/move paths. They are not draft autosaves for unsaved Annotate windows during app quit.
- Full Annotate drag-to-app closes the editor by default. Settings → Annotate → `Close after drop` can be turned off to keep the editor session alive after sharing a rendered copy; `Reactivate after drop` controls whether that preserved editor is activated after drop.
- During recording, the menu bar item stays menu-first instead of left-click-to-stop. It shows the live timer, keeps Preferences reachable, and temporarily excludes the Settings window from own-app recordings when needed.
- Settings -> Advanced exports and imports portable TOML preferences. The
  default path is `~/.config/snapzy/config.toml`; Backup actions stay disabled
  until macOS folder access is granted once, then Snapzy creates the folder/file
  if missing and reuses the security-scoped bookmark. Snapzy debounces
  background app-to-file sync after preference changes, and Open config.toml
  flushes through the same safe sync path before opening. Sync only writes when
  the file still matches Snapzy's last applied/exported signature; external
  edits require confirmation. Direct edits to that file are applied on the next
  app launch when the TOML is valid. Explicit Import replaces the managed config
  file before applying it; Restore defaults replaces it with generated defaults
  after confirmation. Existing users see the onboarding flow open directly on
  the config access step once after upgrading; Settings -> Advanced shows the
  same grant action when access is still missing, plus config sync status and
  Sync Now.

If one of these behaviors changes, update this file, [`STRUCTURE.md`](STRUCTURE.md), [`CAPTURE.md`](CAPTURE.md), and the root [`README.md`](../README.md) in the same change.
