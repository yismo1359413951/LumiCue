## Implementation Notes That Matter

- `ScreenCaptureViewModel` is the main entrypoint for capture actions fired from shortcuts, the status bar menu, or `snapzy://` automation URLs.
- `AppStatusBarController` is the AppKit bridge for the menu bar item. It now keeps the menu accessible during active recording, renders the live recording timer from `ScreenRecordingManager`, and coordinates temporary Preferences-window exclusion for record-own-app sessions.
- Area screenshot now freezes the active display first through `FrozenAreaCaptureSession`, then keeps one overlay session that can toggle between manual region selection and application window selection with the configurable `Application Capture` overlay key. The default key is `A`.
- Area + inline annotate uses `InlineAreaAnnotateCoordinator` with `InlineAreaAnnotateSession` and `InlineAreaAnnotateWindow`. It starts after a frozen all-display snapshot set, creates coordinated per-display panels that share one desktop coordinate space, reuses Annotate state/canvas/export services, and routes the saved image through `PostCaptureActionHandler`.
- `AreaSelectionController` and `AreaSelectionWindow` own the cross-display overlay session, target-display keyboard ownership for screenshot sessions, and highlight rendering for both manual and application screenshot interaction modes.
- `WindowSelectionQueryService` resolves the hovered topmost app window from CoreGraphics window lists plus `SCShareableContent`, so app-mode hover stays accurate without doing expensive live queries on every draw pass. It also propagates the owner PID into `WindowCaptureTarget.ownerPID` for exact window capture metadata.
- `Services/Capture/SmartElement/` owns the standalone Smart Element session. `SmartElementCaptureController` creates live per-screen overlay panels, resolves the topmost non-Snapzy owner with `SmartElementWindowOwnerResolver`, forwards that PID into `SmartElementQueryService`, and commits highlighted rects through `SmartElementCapturePerformer`.
- `SmartElementQueryService` and `AXElementInspector` power Smart Element hover detection. The service throttles cursor updates and dispatches AX queries to a background queue to ensure 60fps performance without blocking the main thread, gates on `AXIsProcessTrusted()`, queries the target app via `AXUIElementCreateApplication(pid)`, walks up to the nearest meaningful AX role, and flips the AX top-left rect into AppKit bottom-left global coordinates before publishing. The protocol seam (`AXSnapshotProviding` + `AXElementSnapshot`) keeps the pipeline unit-testable.
- `PostCaptureActionHandler` executes clipboard copy before slower Quick Access and screenshot auto-open actions after files already exist, so auto-copy is not blocked by thumbnail generation or overlay work.
- `PostCaptureActionHandler` also persists editable annotation sidecars when screenshot default presets are auto-applied before the file reaches clipboard, Quick Access, history, or Annotate auto-open. `ScreenshotPresetAutoApplier` keeps this route lightweight by rendering preset canvas effects directly, without spinning up a full Annotate state object.
- Manual Open Annotate (`⇧⌘A`, menu bar, and `snapzy://open/annotate`) opens an empty editor through `AnnotateManager.openEmptyAnnotation()` and then applies the configured clipboard-image behavior: ask by default, load automatically, or do nothing.
- Settings → Annotate owns full-editor Annotate preferences, including clipboard-image import behavior, `Close after drop`, and `Reactivate after drop`. `Close after drop` defaults on for legacy behavior; `AnnotateWindowController` reads both drag preferences when a drag-to-app session completes.
- `AnnotateManager` restores screenshot editability from the Quick Access session cache first, then `AnnotationSessionStore`, then the flattened screenshot file. `AnnotationSessionStore` stores only committed sessions and validates the source file signature before returning editable data.
- `TempCaptureManager` is where the `Save` after-capture toggle becomes real behavior. Recording uses an internal per-session processing directory first, then moves the final video to export or the temp capture root after AVAssetWriter finishes.
- `DatabaseManager` is initialized before launch cleanup and schedulers run. If `snapzy.db` cannot open or migrate, `AppDelegate` presents repair/reset/quit recovery UI; reset archives existing DB files into `DatabaseRecovery-<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>[-N]/` before creating a fresh database.
- `QuickAccessActionConfigurationStore` owns user-configurable Quick Access action visibility, context-menu order, and card slot assignments. Settings → Quick Access lets users reorder the context menu from the list, then drag actions onto explicit preview slots for the live hover card layout.
- `QuickAccessDraggableView` owns Quick Access card gestures: mouse swipe-to-dismiss, drag-to-app, and optional two-finger horizontal swipe-to-dismiss on the preview card.
- `RecordingCoordinator` owns the toolbar/overlay UX. `ScreenRecordingManager` owns the media pipeline.
- `ScrollingCaptureCoordinator` is its own subsystem. Treat `Services/Capture/ScrollingCapture/*` as a unit.
- `ScrollingCaptureFrameSource` publishes timestamped region frames into `ScrollingCaptureFrameRing`, so live preview and commit/stitch decisions share one bounded frame timeline before falling back to still area capture.
- `CloudManager` is a facade. Provider-specific behavior lives under `Services/Cloud/`.
- `SnapzyConfigurationService` is the Settings-facing facade for TOML export/import. `SnapzyConfigurationAccessGranting` shares the config folder grant flow between upgrade onboarding and Settings -> Advanced, creating `~/.config/snapzy` and `config.toml` after a successful grant if either is missing. Settings import validates the selected `.toml`, replaces the managed `config.toml`, then applies it so app state and file state stay aligned. Open config.toml syncs current settings into the managed file first when the file still matches Snapzy's last applied/exported signature; if the file has unapplied external edits, Settings asks before replacing it. `SnapzyConfigurationAutoImporter` runs during startup, hashes `config.toml`, and imports only when the file changed since the last successful launch-time apply. Import paths validate the whole file before applying any mutation and intentionally exclude Keychain secrets, history rows, temp captures, and sandbox bookmarks.
- `Shared/Localization/L10n.swift` is the bridge for user-facing copy that does not live directly in SwiftUI view literals.
- `Resources/Localization/Shared/*.xcstrings` and `Resources/Localization/Features/*.xcstrings` are the runtime localization catalogs.
- `tools/localization/CatalogTool.swift` owns audit and verify for split localization catalogs.
- `Resources/*/InfoPlist.strings` still own privacy permission text.
- Keep brand names, file formats, key labels, MIME types, and other technical tokens verbatim unless product behavior explicitly changes.

## Test Architecture

Snapzy uses peer test roots at the repository root so test code stays out of
the app source folder and Xcode can bind each root to the correct target.

- **SnapzyTests** — Unit Testing Bundle. Mirrors the `Snapzy/` source tree by
  domain, for example `SnapzyTests/Services/Capture/*Tests.swift` tests
  `Snapzy/Services/Capture/*`.
- **SnapzyUITests** — planned UI Testing Bundle for end-to-end user flows.

Current Xcode project contract:

- `Snapzy.xcodeproj` has a file-system synchronized root group for
  `SnapzyTests/`.
- The shared `Snapzy` scheme uses `Snapzy.xctestplan`, which includes
  `SnapzyTests` in its Test action.
- Test helpers live in `SnapzyTests/Helpers/`.
- Fixtures, when needed, should live in `SnapzyTests/Fixtures/`.

Do not place XCTest files under `Snapzy/`; that folder is synchronized into the
app target.

Directory structure mirrors the app: `SnapzyTests/Services/Cloud/AWSV4SignerTests.swift` tests `Snapzy/Services/Cloud/AWSV4Signer.swift`. Shared mocks and fixture assets live in `SnapzyTests/Helpers/` and `SnapzyTests/Fixtures/`.

### Test Priority

| Layer | Type | Priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Services/Cloud/AWSV4Signer` | Unit | **P0** | Pure crypto, zero deps |
| `Services/Cloud/LifecycleXMLParser` | Unit | **P0** | Pure XML parsing |
| `Services/Capture/CaptureOutputNaming` | Unit | **P0** | Template + sanitization |
| `Shared/Extensions/` | Unit | **P0** | Pure utilities |
| `Services/Media/` | Unit | **P1** | Vision/CoreImage, needs fixture images |
| `Services/Capture/TempCaptureManager` | Unit | **P1** | File lifecycle, mock `FileManager` |
| `Services/Capture/PostCaptureActionHandler` | Unit | **P1** | Routing logic, protocol DI |
| `Services/Cloud/CloudManager` | Integration | **P2** | Facade, mock providers |
| `Features/Capture/CaptureViewModel` | Unit | **P2** | State transitions only, high coupling |
| `Features/Onboarding/`, `Features/Preferences/` | UI | **P3** | XCUITest |

### Key Constraints

- Test target needs its own entitlements (copy `Snapzy.entitlements`, drop Sparkle keys).
- Use `UserDefaults(suiteName: "SnapzyTests")` to isolate test state.
- `@MainActor` singletons (`TempCaptureManager.shared`) require `@MainActor` test methods.
- `SCShareableContent`/`SCStream` cannot be mocked — test capture logic through `CaptureOutputNaming` and `PostCaptureActionHandler` instead.
- OCR fixtures: bundle test images in `SnapzyTests/Fixtures/`, load via `Bundle(for: type(of: self))`.
- CI: GitHub Actions macOS 14+ runners have Screen Recording permission. Older runners: `try XCTSkipUnless(CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess())`.

## Current Behavior Clarifications

- `Upload to Cloud & copy link` in Preferences enables manual cloud actions in Quick Access for screenshots, videos, and GIFs, plus Annotate for screenshots; it does not auto-run inside `PostCaptureActionHandler`.
- Quick Access can outlive the original capture location: saved captures stay in the export folder, temp captures are deleted when dismissed unless the user explicitly saves them.
- Two-finger swipe-to-dismiss is scoped to the Quick Access preview card and follows the same side-aware dismiss direction as mouse swipe: rightward on right-side panels, leftward on left-side panels.
- Committed screenshot annotations are stored as sidecar packages in Application Support. History/Quick Access restore uses those packages to reopen editable annotations after the rendered screenshot has been saved, while delete, clear-history, retention sweep, and temp-to-export save paths remove or move sidecars with the source file.
- Sidecar persistence is intentionally commit-based. There is no continuous annotation autosave or draft recovery package for an unsaved Annotate window during app quit.
- Quick Access screenshot pin opens an independent always-on-top pin window with fit-based sizing, a minimum interactive footprint, compact zoom/drag controls, pinch and Command-scroll zoom, close or Esc-to-unpin, drag-to-app from the current pinned image, and a lock mode that fades the screenshot while allowing pointer interaction with windows underneath except for the unlock control.
- Annotate, Video Editor, GIF conversion, and cloud upload pause Quick Access countdowns for the active item and resume them when the activity ends.
- During recording, the menu bar item no longer turns into a left-click stop button. It keeps the normal menu path available, adds a live timer to the status item, and exposes stop plus pause/resume from the active menu section.
- When Preferences is opened during an active recording with own-app capture enabled, Snapzy temporarily excludes that Settings window from the stream instead of forcing the user to stop recording first.
- TOML config import is all-or-nothing for validation errors. Warnings, such as
  imported folder paths that may need macOS file-access confirmation, are shown
  after import and do not block applied changes.
- `~/.config/snapzy/config.toml` is not live-watched for direct edits. Valid
  direct edits are applied when Snapzy launches again, after macOS folder access
  has been granted once through onboarding or Settings -> Advanced. Opening the
  file from Settings first syncs app-originated settings changes when doing so
  will not silently overwrite unapplied external edits.
- Existing users who have already completed onboarding see the onboarding flow
  open directly on the config access step once when launch-time auto-import
  detects missing folder access. Skipping it leaves a warning/action in
  Settings -> Advanced.
